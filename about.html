                <p>I’d like to share a bit more about myself. I was born and raised in Central Florida and have a passion for pickleball, gardening, and traveling.
                     I feel most joyful when I’m exploring new activities and being productive. 
                    I find tranquility near natural bodies of water or after successfully debugging a complex issue.<br/></p>

                <p>After graduating from high school, I made the decision to join the Air Force—a choice I consider one of my best. 
                    During my time on active duty, I undertook a special assignment as an alarm monitor, which sparked my curiosity and deepened my interest in technology.
                    In this role, I gained valuable experience in system administration and worked on the AGEON software to help mitigate intrusion incidents. 
                    I also honed essential skills in technical documentation and managing high-value inventory.<br/></p>

                <p>While serving, I enrolled in Bellevue University, pursuing a degree in Software Development. 
                    After completing my active duty service, I transitioned to a government contractor role at USSTRATCOM as an IT desk analyst, where I obtained a Top Secret security clearance. 
                    This position gave me the opportunity to learn foundational cybersecurity principles, review STIGs, and earn my Security+ certification.
                    I also gained hands-on experience in maintaining and troubleshooting cloud-based software.<br/></p>
                
                <p>With my accumulated experience, I’ve developed a deep passion for software development and cybersecurity. 
                    My goal is to become a software engineer who designs secure, innovative applications, always pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>
